Alliance Pharmaceutical Corp. and IL YANG Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd Announce a Licensing, Development and Marketing Agreement for Oxygent(TM) in Korea 898 words 19 April 2004 19:58 PR Newswire (U.S.) PRN English Copyright Ã‚Â© 2004 PR Newswire Association LLC. All Rights Reserved. SAN DIEGO, April 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Alliance Pharmaceutical Corp. (BULLETIN BOARD: ALLP) , through its wholly owned subsidiary PFC Therapeutics, LLC, and IL YANG Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (IL YANG") today announced the signing of a Licensing, Development and Marketing Agreement ("Agreement") between PFC Therapeutics and IL YANG, granting IL YANG exclusive rights to distribute and commercialize Oxygent(TM) in South Korea. IL YANG is one of the top Korean pharmaceutical R&D and marketing companies. Oxygent (perflubron emulsion) is a patent-protected, stable, and concentrated perfluorochemical (PFC)-based synthetic oxygen therapeutic developed by Alliance, which has been evaluated in late-stage clinical studies for avoidance of red blood cell transfusions during surgery. Under terms of the Agreement, IL YANG will have the exclusive right to promote, market, distribute and sell Oxygent throughout South Korea. PFC Therapeutics will be responsible for commercial supply of Oxygent, which IL YANG will purchase from PFC, and PFC will receive a royalty from IL YANG on sales of Oxygent following commercialization in South Korea. IL YANG will also make certain future payments to PFC on the completion of various regulatory milestones for Oxygent development in Europe and the United States. COSMO USA, Inc. a medical industry consulting company served an integral role in bringing the two companies together for this unique partnership. PFC Therapeutics retains exclusive rights to Oxygent in the U.S. and for the rest of the world (excluding South Korea and Europe). For Europe, Alliance announced on April 5, 2004 the signing of a collaboration agreement between PFC Therapeutics and Nycomed, a leading European pharmaceutical company based in Denmark, for Nycomed to assume responsibility for the remaining clinical and regulatory development and future marketing to commercialize Oxygent throughout a broad European territory (and a potential option to acquire rights for China). "We are very pleased to have IL YANG as our exclusive licensee for future commercialization of Oxygent in South Korea, which represents a significant and important market in Asia," commented Duane J. Roth, Chairman and CEO of Alliance. "IL YANG represents the top pharmaceutical company in Korea, making them an    ideal partner for Alliance and for expanding our international efforts to develop and commercialize Oxygent." "We believe that Oxygent represents a unique product that is ideally suited to potentially address the increasing demand for alternatives to allogeneic (donor) blood transfusion in surgical patients," said Tae Sook Yoo, CEO of IL YANG Pharmaceutical Co. "Once the remaining clinical development is completed, we intend to focus IL YANG's corporate assets, excellent reputation and proven marketing skills to ensure successful commercialization of Oxygent in South Korea, since this product could become a valuable alternative to perioperative             red cell transfusion at a time when the safety and limited availability of donor blood is an important      medical issue for both physicians and their patients." About ALLIANCE Alliance Pharmaceutical Corp., founded in 1989, is a development stage pharmaceutical company that is currently focused on developing its lead product, Oxygent. Alliance is currently the only company that has advanced a synthetic PFC emulsion-based oxygen therapeutic into late-stage multi-center international clinical trials in both Europe and North America. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, PFC Therapeutics, Alliance is developing Oxygent as a temporary red blood cell substitute, based on its proprietary PFC and surfactant technologies. The goal of the remaining clinical development program will be to seek marketing approvals for an indication to use Oxygent during surgery when tissues are in acute need of additional oxygen supply, and thereby decrease or avoid the need for transfusion of donor blood. Alliance will remain responsible for development of Oxygent and future commercialization in the U.S., and will continue with ongoing efforts to secure agreements for selected other countries.
